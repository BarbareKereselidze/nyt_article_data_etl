(Agence France-Presse)    THE AMERICAS    HONDURAS, NICARAGUA: MILITARY PACT  Honduras and Nicaragua have agreed to freeze ground troop deployments and withdraw naval forces from the Caribbean Sea to avert military conflict pending resolution of a border dispute, an official with the Organization of American States said. Relations soured in November when the Honduran Congress ratified an accord that claimed for Honduras and Colombia 52,000 square miles of Caribbean coastal waters, parts of which are also claimed by Nicaragua.    (Reuters)    PARAGUAY: CABINET MINISTER QUITS  Agriculture Minister Oscar Denis quit after his Liberal Party voted to abandon the coalition government of President Luis Gonzalez Macchi. The party's leadership voted to pull out after talks to obtain more government posts failed. The decision faces ratification by party members at a convention in February.    (Reuters)    COLOMBIA: LEADER VETOES GENOCIDE BILL  In an unex-pected reversal, President Andres Pastrana vetoed a bill that would have made genocide and forced disappearance criminal acts. His administration shifted course after the armed forces complained that such a law would leave soldiers open to prosecution, in civilian rather than military courts, for deaths inflicted in combat with leftist guerrillas.    Larry Rohter (NYT)    MIDDLE EAST    IRAN: CALL TO DESTROY ISRAEL  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, called for the destruction of Israel, saying it was the only way to solve the Middle East's problems. His remarks came as millions of people rallied across Iran to protest Israel's control of Jerusalem, where Muslims believe Muhammad began his journey to heaven.    (AP)    LEBANON: HEZBOLLAH'S VOW  The Hezbollah movement said it intended to keep up its attacks on Israeli troops in south Lebanon, a day after a suicide bombing narrowly missed an Israeli patrol near the village of Qlaia, wounding 12 Lebanese civilians and an Israeli soldier. ''Hezbollah operations will not stop before or after the negotiations'' between Israel and Syria, a Hezbollah press official said.

"''But where are the snows of yesteryear?'' the poet Francois Villon asked in the 15th century, not even halfway through the millennium we are making a fuss about leaving. Nothing new under the sun, though in his case it was not an early global-warming alert but a lament for departed loveliness. Nothing new there either.    Maybe the past is prologue, but here at the changing of the hundred- and thousand-year guard, prologue is chiefly the past.

He had been ailing for close to two years, from heart failure and then lymphoma, but it still came as a surprise to see him yielding at last instead of rallying, as he had so many times before. My mother took the most extraordinary care of him, which included packing him off to the office for a few hours every day, right up until the week of his death. I rarely visited my father at his office, where he worked as an investment banker, but I knew that its ongoing affairs were more crucial to him, in many ways, than the life he led at home -- just as I knew that his public face as a philanthropist was easier to read than his private face as a father or husband. My father was an Orthodox Jew who had grown up in Leipzig, Germany; he remained committed to Jewish causes until his death, and his knowledge of the dizzying intricacies of Israeli politics was impressive. Throughout his life my father supported Jewish scholarship; he also helped endow the kosher kitchen at Mount Sinai, as well as the Merkin Concert Hall on West 67th Street (which is silent from Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown, in observance of the Sabbath).",6,46.0,The New York Times,[],"{'main': 'The Lives They Lived: Hermann Merkin, b. 1907; The Public Father', 'kicker': None, 'content_kicker': None, 'print_headline': 'The Lives They Lived: Hermann Merkin, b. 1907; The Public Father', 'name': None, 'seo': None, 'sub': None}","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Philanthropy', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Biographical Information', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",2000-01-02 05:00:00+00:00,article,Magazine Desk,Magazine,"{'original': 'By Daphne Merkin', 'person': [{'firstname': 'Daphne', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Merkin', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}], 'organization': None}",News,nyt://article/34834634-76ae-5d12-8355-f2ee7a4dfb53,1031.0,nyt://article/34834634-76ae-5d12-8355-f2ee7a4dfb53,

These portable packs of fragrance resemble shimmering silk tea bags and are filled with tiny perfumed beads. They're designed to be tucked into a shirt pocket, tied in the hair or thrown into a pocketbook. (They can also be used more conventionally in a dresser drawer or closet.) Marie Dumont, the company's creative director, said the goal was maximum aromatic versatility: wearers can switch scents at will. And the personal sachets also work for people with sensitive skin, who don't react well to direct application of perfumes or colognes. In addition to the spicy fragrance found in the tea bags, L'Artisan also offers small rectangular sachets in amber and blackberry scents, with colorful silk tassels intended to dangle outside a breast pocket. Prices are $10 each for the tea bags and $25 to $35 for the sachets. The first sachets arrived at Barneys New York last week, sold out and are on reorder. Have scratch, will sniff.

" Nureyev: His Life   By Diane Solway. Morrow, $16.    The author draws on extensive interviews and research to provide fresh material on the Russian dancer's life and career, particularly his Soviet years and his defection in 1961. This balanced biography is ''informative and filled with vivid anecdotes,'' Jennifer Dunning wrote here in 1998.    The Peculiar Memories of Thomas Penman   By Bruce Robinson. HarperPerennial, $13.    The hero of this darkly funny first novel by the writer and director of ''Withnail and I'' is a 13-year-old asthmatic schoolboy searching for identity as he copes with his exotically dysfunctional family in working-class England in the grim 1950's. He is an obsessive snooper, and what he's most keen to find is the key to his grandfather's extensive pornography collection. ''Never before has the painful, knotty journey to maturity been depicted with such gusto, and never has the venerable Bildungsroman received such riotously profane treatment,'' Patrick McGrath wrote here last year.    Secrecy: The American Experience   By Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Yale University, $10.95.    In this withering tour of nearly a century of official secrecy, the New York senator argues that the use of classified information and misinformation has caused much more harm than good. ''It is a dismaying tale,'' Sam Tanenhaus wrote here in 1998, though Moynihan tells it ''with uncommon liveliness and a mordant wit.'' In All the Laws but One: Civil Liberties in Wartime, by William H. Rehnquist (Vintage, $14), the chief justice of the United States reviews prominent cases in which civil liberties issues have arisen during times of war, from the 1860's to the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II. ''Rehnquist presents full and fascinating human profiles'' and conveys ''what it must have been like to grapple with these issues in a time of crisis,'' Jeremy Waldron wrote here last year.    Ingratitude   By Ying Chen. University of California, $13.95.    This compact novel is narrated from the grave by a woman who committed suicide to punish her mother and thus escape the traditional Chinese culture of obedience. The result is ''a sustained philosophical exploration studded with passionate outbursts, a glimpse of a consciousness liberated from family and social expectations,'' Elizabeth Schmidt wrote here in 1998.    Ark Baby   By Liz Jensen. Overlook, $13.95.    This raucous, unruly novel is a satirical jab at Darwinism and the notion of scientific certainty through 150 years of British life, up to the early years of the new millennium, when a fertility crisis threatens the survival of Homo britannicus. '' 'Ark Baby' is written in an exuberantly naughty style that suggests Jensen shares a certain kinship with writers like Peter Carey and Fay Weldon,'' Alida Becker wrote here in 1998.    Hip Hop America   By Nelson George. Penguin, $13.95.    A New York music critic traces the evolution of rap music and its influence on culture and society, in the process chronicling his own intense love-hate relationship with hip-hop. In 1998 our reviewer, Laura Jamison, called this ''an invaluable, entertaining and well-written account.'' In Elevating the Game: Black Men and Basketball (University of Nebraska, $15), George explores the history of basketball and how the integration of black players from colleges around the nation advanced the game. The result is a ''folksy yet scholarly study'' and ''a rich, welcome addition to sports literature,'' Michael E. Ross wrote here in 1992.    Meetings With the Archangel: A Comedy of Spirit   By Stephen Mitchell. HarperPerennial, $13.    The celestial visitor in question stops by to deliver a primer on the afterlife and give the novel's narrator a chance to review his spiritual progress, as well as provide the author with an opportunity to display his religious learning. In 1998 our reviewer, David Guy, called this a ''fascinating and beautifully written'' book.    Joy of Man's Desiring   By Jean Giono. Counterpoint, $16.    This earthy French novel about the loves and toils of a group of peasants in the rugged, isolated hills of Provence is a pagan allegory about the fragile communion between man and nature. ''It is a beautiful story of renewal . . . set in terms of a kind of cosmic faith, and in a lovely and fearless imagery,'' Katherine Woods wrote here in 1940.    Canone Inverso   By Paolo Maurensig. Owl/Holt, $12.    This Italian novel, steeped in musical imagery and themes, revolves around a haunted 17th-century violin and its effect on the friendship of two boys in Central Europe during the 1930's. Last year our reviewer, Jonathan Keates, admired ''the mournful beauty of this sparely proportioned, soberly recounted story.''    The Grieving Time: A Year's Account of Recovery From Loss   By Anne M. Brooks. Herodias, $11.    This slender, heartfelt book is a monthly journal kept by the author after her husband's death from cancer. The ''entries are sometimes startling in their candor,'' one critic wrote in 1985. ''It will linger in the mind and give comfort'' for a long time.

Jenny McPhee reviews book Partisan Wedding by Renata Vigano; drawing (M),https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/02/books/books-in-brief-fiction-poetry-italy-s-women-warriors.html,Jenny McPhee reviews book Partisan Wedding by Renata Vigano; drawing (M),"PARTISAN WEDDING (University of Missouri, paper, $19.95), Renata ViganRated R's spare and heart-wrenching story collection, is centered on women involved in the Italian resistance during World War II. The author, who died in 1976, was herself a courier, or staffetta, for the partisans who fought the Germans near Bologna; she fictionalized her experiences and those of other women she knew in these captivating and vivid stories. The title story describes the humble wedding of a servant, Marina, to a partisan in a hilltop hideout. Set against the backdrop of wartime Italy, the ominous mood surrounding the ceremony, together with the bride and groom's innocence, establishes the tone for the collection and introduces one of the book's dominant themes: how the clandestine war was fought on a personal level. In ''Campalbo'' a 13-year-old girl whose father was shot by the Germans proudly risks her life to bring newspapers to the partisans hiding in the hills. Many of ViganRated R's stories depict women deliberately using their sexuality in order to achieve a desired goal. In ''Red Flag,'' a woman hides ammunition under her used sanitary napkins. In ''Argelide,'' a former prostitute poses as the madam of a brothel so that Germans won't suspect her house as a partisan meeting place. ''The Last Action'' tells the story of a German sympathizer who seduces a partisan in order to get him to reveal his colleagues' names. Suzanne Branciforte's translation beautifully renders ViganRated R's simple but passionate prose into English, and her informative introduction rightfully claims for ViganRated R the invaluable contribution her writing has made to the literature of World War II.

But the prints are proof that, if the earth itself is not alive, its whole surface is always moving. Wind, water, tectonic plates and people are slow agents, but the marks of change are vast; the images capture eons in a moment. Whether you look down on the Lakagigar volcanoes in Iceland or the man-made windbreaks of the Aran Islands, you know Galileo said more than he meant when he insisted, ''It moves.'' Almost 200 of Arthus-Bertrand's images are lavishly reproduced in EARTH FROM ABOVE (Abrams, $65). The project was sponsored by Unesco, and the book has commentaries by French scientists who worry about humanity covering the planet too fast. But the photographs undermine their eloquence; to paraphrase John Lyly, the pictures are honey though the words are gall. From above, acres of carpets laid out on the sands of Morocco or even the dumps of Mexico City are as gorgeous as the autumn forests of Quebec or the mineral ''forest'' of Madagascar. Shots of the sprawl of monstrous cities are not reassuring, but over all one marvels at how naturally humanity's endless sand-castling fits into nature. And what a work nature is! Everywhere -- in cosmic brush strokes of bacteria in the Grand Prismatic Spring of Yellowstone or minerals washed over by the Rio Carrao in Venezuela -- the earth creates color and patterns that reduce human art to its proper place. ''Earth From Above'' is translated from French (by David Baker), and here and there one is reminded of the pitfalls of translation, as when it tells us the Yankees are ''the most winningest team'' in baseball, and of how iffy proofreading is in any language, as when it says the Maldives are ''120 isles or islets, of which almost 420 are inhabited.''

"In a welcome anticlimax to two years of dire warnings, the new millennium arrived over the weekend without a computer-driven meltdown of the globe's electronic infrastructure. So far even  the countries that did not spend vast sums to prepare for a Y2K-bug disaster have been spared major problems, raising questions about whether all the planning and expense were necessary. The speculation about what might have happened had there been no preparation is intriguing and inevitable. But common sense suggests that inaction  was not an option for government and business leaders once the experts determined the existence of a threat to power grids, defense systems, air transport, financial communications and other vital linkages.    Among most computer specialists, the fear of a serious crisis was real. As just about everyone came to learn, their anxiety was that computers would break down because of an inability to recognize the year 2000. A year or so ago, Wired magazine reported that many leading software engineers were themselves planning to spend the New Year's weekend in remote places with stocks of water, cash and food on hand. That fear now seems exaggerated, but it was not entirely fanciful. It reflected the essential fact that even the experts do not fully comprehend the complexity of the systems that now undergird the world's computers. John Koskinen, chairman of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion, has warned that it may take weeks or months to be sure that the millennium bug is completely behind us.

These dimensions warped into a heightened configuration on Friday night, when thousands gathered to watch the ball drop as the Earth revolved New York City into the new millennium's dawn.    Even ephemeral things have a history, however. And the spectacle we see at Times Square first took shape in 1932 in the imagination of the German architect Oskar Nitzchke. That year, Nitzchke began to design a project he called la Maison de la Publicite (Publicity House). Intended for a site on the Champs-Elysees, the proposed building featured what people would later call a media wall. An immense crane, attached to the building's roof line, would be constantly at work, arranging and rearranging an ever-changing array of illuminated commercial signs deployed across a metal grid facade.

" DEAR DIARY:    On the week before Christmas, Rockefeller Center was swarming with the usual holiday crowds. Onlookers, three people deep, hovered above the rink watching the skaters glide around the ice. Suddenly, in the center of the rink, a man dropped to one knee and held out his hand to a young woman who was looking down at him, smiling. A small circle of skaters formed around the couple. A hush fell over the hundreds of fascinated witnesses, including myself. We held our breath and watched. People began murmuring, ''He's proposing, he's proposing.'' While the murmuring was going on, the young woman must have said yes because the couple began hugging each other. Everyone, skaters and spectators, applauded. It was a great moment.

"Every evening, just at dusk, I carry two hay bales into the middle pasture. One goes into the high feed-bunk, the other into the feeder just below it. Each bale is bound by two strings of sisal baling twine. I cut the strings near their knots, which were tied by a mechanical baler sometime late last summer in a Massachusetts hayfield. The bale springs apart, and the hay falls into flakes. I coil the strings into a neat loop and put them in my pocket. There is at least one coil of twine in every jacket I own and another in the hip pocket of every pair of jeans. On this place, baling twine is the thread of life.     Not that it gets used for much. It ties down tarps and ties up tomato vines and rose canes. It piles up day by day in an empty grain sack or a cardboard box in the barn. The horses are easier to catch with a double length of twine-string, as my farming cousins called it, than with a proper halter, and the horses are also gentle enough to be led that way. I know ranch hands in Wyoming who never ride out without a loop of the stuff -- usually the orange plastic kind -- knotted to a saddle-string or a D-ring.

"Long ago, political parties had a heavy hand in picking their presidential nominees. Now, in most big states except New York, voters do the picking in primaries or political caucuses. Through an arcane system that requires even candidates who have qualified nationally for federal election funds to amass signatures and jump through qualifying hoops, New York's political parties have, by mutual legislative agreement, limited the candidates on their ballots to two Democrats, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley, and as few as one Republican in some areas, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.    The Democrats have made it easier for candidates' names to appear on their ballot, requiring  a campaign to get only 5,000 valid signatures statewide, as opposed to about 20,000 for the Republicans.  But even the lesser requirement is onerous, undemocratic and outdated. New York's entire  ballot-qualification exercise ranks as a political throwback to the old party-boss days before voters could see and assess the various candidates on television. For that reason, states like California automatically add the names of those considered ''viable'' by the media. Some states include any candidate qualified for federal funds or ask for a modest filing fee. Unlike New York, these states want to offer voters a basic political right: the ability to choose among all available candidates for a given office.

Our current foreign policy debate is not over whether to retreat into isolationism, but over how we should relate to the rest of the world.

"As scientists look back at all the discoveries made in the 1990's, the so-called Decade of the Brain, one finding stands out as the most startling and, for many scientists, the most difficult to accept: people are not necessarily born with all the brain cells they will ever have.     In fact, from birth through late adolescence, the brain appears to add billions of new cells, literally constructing its circuits out of freshly made neurons as children and teenagers interact with their environments. In adulthood, the process of adding new cells slows down but does not stop. Mature circuits appear to be maintained by new cell growth well into old age.
